# Plain-text IO performance: benchmarks 1/2
In the previous post, I discussed what affects plain-text IO performance. Now I benchmark different approaches for stdin/stdout IO in native and managed code.

## Native plain text IO performance

A typical choice for competitive programming is C++ language. Because it is native, it is considered fast, with no overhead, and with zero-cost abstractions. But is it true, especially for IO performance?

There are some popular tips for getting the best IO performance with C++:
 - Prefer C-style `scanf/printf` over C++ `cin/cout` because they are much faster
 - If you like `cin/cout` as easy-to-use constructs, reduce their cost by adding "magic spells" to your code. For the explanation of this "spells", please look into [Technical Report on C++ Performance, 5.6.7, page 63](https://www.stroustrup.com/Performance-TR.pdf#page=63)
    ```c++
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    ```
 - Use `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` for line breaks

I will test C++ IO and these tips against different compilers and scenarios. Then I will repeat these measurements for .NET

It is not fully correct benchmark for Plain-text IO. E.g. there is different hardware for Windows and Linux. It is only estimation based on a small number of cases. If you want to reproduce measurements in your environment or other test cases, you could start from the [benchmark sources](https://github.com/epeshk/TextIOBenchmarks).

### Benchmark running
I will use the [Benchmark.NET](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.html) for my measurements. Although this library was designed for benchmarking of the .NET code, it contains a lot of useful benchmarking stuff like test case combination, time measurement, statistics, aggregation, and result presentation. It is also a commonly known tool that makes benchmarks easy to modify and reproduce.

The benchmarked method will invoke another executable. Overhead was measured by an empty program run.

Mention that the input data are stored in memory. The output could be drained to `Stream.Null` or also stored in memory, e.g. for validation.
```csharp
[Benchmark]
public void Run() => Run(ProgramExecutable, PreloadedInput)

public static void Run(string program, byte[] input)
{
    var psi = new ProcessStartInfo(program)
    {
        RedirectStandardInput = true,
        RedirectStandardOutput = true,
        CreateNoWindow = true
    };

    var process = Process.Start(psi);
    var reader = Task.Run(() => process.StandardOutput.BaseStream.CopyToAsync(Stream.Null));

    var stdin = process.StandardInput.BaseStream;
    stdin.Write(input);
    stdin.Flush();

    reader.Wait();
    process.WaitForExit();
}
```

### Environment
OS: Windows 10, Ubuntu 22.04
Compilers:
 - Windows: MSVC 19.31.31107 from VS Community 2022, MinGW g++ 12.2.0
 - Linux: g++
I will only post a 64-bit case for readability, but you could test for 32-bit on your own

### Input data
 - pregenerated 6 digit random integers: 10^5 <= a_i < 10^6$, $N = 200000$

### Scenario 0: overhead measurement, empty program

#### Windows:
|    Program | Compiler | Median |
|----------- |--------- |-------:|
|      empty |    g++64 |  14 ms |
|      empty |   msvc64 |  14 ms |

#### Linux:
|    Program | Compiler | Median |
|----------- |--------- |-------:|
|      empty |    g++64 | 300 us |

The overhead on Linux is much lower than on Windows. Probably, it is because creating the new process with the `fork` call is much faster, but it (and the startup time overall) is a good topic to revisit in the future.

### Scenario 1: input reading (5 MB)
In this scenario program should read a big input and then output a short answer (XOR for each column of the input), only for correctness check.
Programs:
 - cin — `std::cin` used for reading
 - cin_fast/cin_cout_fast — `std::cin` used for reading, configured with `sync_with_stdio` and `tie`
 - scanf — `scanf` used for reading
 - fastscan — custom parsing, based on `_getchar_nolock` on Windows and `getchar_unlocked` on Linux

#### Windows:
|  Program | Compiler | Mean (Int) | Mean (Double) |
|--------- |--------- |-----------:|--------------:|
| fastscan |   msvc64 |      34 ms |             - |
| fastscan |    g++64 |      45 ms |             - |
| cin_fast |    g++64 |      74 ms |       1650 ms |
|    scanf |   msvc64 |      76 ms |        100 ms |
|    scanf |    g++64 |     190 ms |        310 ms |
| cin_fast |   msvc64 |     243 ms |        274 ms |
|      cin |   msvc64 |     271 ms |        300 ms |
|      cin |    g++64 |     424 ms |       2000 ms |

#### Linux:
|  Program | Compiler | Mean (Int) | Mean (Double) |
|--------- |--------- |-----------:|--------------:|
| fastscan |    g++64 |      14 ms |             - |
| cin_fast |    g++64 |      38 ms |        101 ms |
|    scanf |    g++64 |      44 ms |         70 ms |
|      cin |    g++64 |     148 ms |        220 ms |


### Scenario 2: Large input and output: echo (5 MB/5 MB)

Echo (read, parse, and write) 200000 lines with 4 numbers each

#### Windows:
|       Program | Compiler |      Mean | Mean (Double) |
|-------------- |--------- |----------:|--------------:|
| cin_cout_fast |    g++64 |    109 ms |       1911 ms |
|  printf_scanf |   msvc64 |    130 ms |        262 ms |
|  printf_scanf |    g++64 |    280 ms |        470 ms |
| cin_cout_fast |   msvc64 |    438 ms |        680 ms |
|      cin_cout |   msvc64 |    800 ms |       1050 ms |
|      cin_cout |    g++64 |    820 ms |       2790 ms |

#### Linux:
|       Program | Compiler | Mean (Int) | Mean (Double) |
|-------------- |--------- |-----------:|--------------:|
| cin_cout_fast |    g++64 |      80 ms |        376 ms |
|         scanf |    g++64 |      82 ms |        260 ms |
|      cin_cout |    g++64 |     430 ms |        804 ms |

## Conclusion
Text IO performance heavily depends on the target platform and runtime, and there is no single advice for the best result. But now we know some numbers for comparison with other runtimes.
